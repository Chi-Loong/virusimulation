## virusimulation
A simulation of virus spread in a town, visualized. You can find the live version of this at:
[https://showcase.vslashr.com/virus/index.html](https://showcase.vslashr.com/virus/index.html)

## Installation and Usage
Necessary packages are mostly bundled (save for some CDNs and font files). You can run the visualization by opening up the index.html file on any modern browser.

Change the models by tweaking the parameters in the JS files.

What is this mucking about with bootstrap and JQuery? Couldn't you use a modern frontend framework like Vue or React?

And why is the javascript sometimes embedded in the HTML, and could you use good programming practices instead of using *var* all over the place?

I apologize for being an old school programmer with lots of baggage. This project was a hack, and I pulled lots of old code to patch it together (especially the UX side).

When I have time I will componentize this into a Vue framework!
